							<h3>About the project</h3>
							<p>As human beings, we love a long and healthy life. However, in today's technological era, severely ill children in poor rural areas, rare disease patients in highly developed countries and entire groups of individuals around the world do not have access to quality treatments. Despite global laws and legislations that, all, aim to protect our fundamental right to a healthy life, allocating health on an individual basis of medical necessity has historically been technologically infeasible. However blockchain technology, today, allows the maximization of population health on an individual basis. More specifically,the allocation is on a peer-to-peer basis where all peers, however, agree that the most severely affected is prioritized. And this allocation is also economically optimal. So, apart from being in line with all laws and legislations that aim to protect our fundamental right to a long and healthy life, and apart from being in line with the moral imperative to rescue individuals who are seen to suffer, e-HEAL also achieves economic optimality. </p>

							<h3>Abstract of whitepaper</h3>
							<p>e-HEAL is a collection of decentralised health technology applications, ranging from mobile diagnostic applications to statistical applications, that can execute both in parallel and in sequence in order to collectively manage a sustainable health financing fund, a safety net with an essential rule that the strength of the net increases with increasing medical necessity; thereby defining a totally decentralised and autonomous application specific health economic allocator. Governance is carried out through simple axioms of rationality by parties with a vested long term interest and is based on a transparent voting system concerning accuracy of information, importance towards e-HEAL goals, severity of a condition and others. Net income into the fund is expected mostly from life improving interventions and net outgo from the fund is expected mostly to life saving interventions. The sustainability of the fund is ensured via reserve programs. </p>
