								<h3>e-HEAL: Potential problems</h3>
								<p>Hurdles are not absent in erecting a decentralised and autonomous organisation. While e-HEAL functions on a peer-to-peer basis, typical concepts and important requirements in representative democracies are redefined. Accountability, for example, is of key importance in a health allocation scheme where lives are at stake. Accountability is essentially defined by a relationship between an actor and a forum, in which the actor has an obligation to explain his or her decisions and may face the consequences that unfold from a decision tree. e-HEAL, on the other hand, allows all members of the forum to share in  the role of the actor and thus dissolves the roles of the actor and the forum into one another. However, while peers choose to take an active role or a passive role, an essential network rule that all participating peers agree to is that the most severely ill are prioritized. And, when two parties agree that the most unfavourably affected between them is prioritized, then the network ultimately converges  to a medical safety net whose strength increases with increasing necessity. And, all peers are, collectively, accountable in upholding the essential network rule. However, in order to avoid any hurdles about the legal existence of an autonomous organisation, it might also be possible that holders of our governance token choose to legally own the organisation. Legal existance of e-HEAL DAO could ease much of the interactions where smart contracts would be difficult.</p>
